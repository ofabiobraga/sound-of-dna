# Sound of DNA

Prototype software implementing an algorithm to sonify genetic data in FASTA format. It's part of my graduation final project for the Computer Engineering course.

## Pr√©-requisitos
- Docker

### Get Started
Run this command to build project locally. It will create Docker containers and all prerequisites will be installed.

```bash
make build
```

After that, the project is ready to be served and exposed on top of FastAPI. Just run the command below.
```bash
make serve
```

It can now be accessed from any web browser on the URL https://localhost:8000.

If you need to stop server, just run the command below.
```bash
make stop
```

To remove files generated by the sonification algorithm, you can clean it running 
```bash
make clean
```
